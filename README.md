# Modeling and simulation of mechatronic systems [140469]
## Project

Delivered project for the Modeling and Simulation of Mechatronics System course of the master degree in Autonomous System (EIT), University of Trento.
Course professor: Francesco Biral.
Collaborators: *[Matteo Mastrogiuseppe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteomastrogiuseppe/)* and *[Giacomo Mutti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giacomo-mutti/)*.

The course focused on the study of mechatronics systems, both open and closed chain.
For studying the kinematic, we saw the recursive, the global, and the natural coordinates approaches.
For the dynamic, we saw the newton-euler approach, the lagrange approach and D'Alambert principle (principle of virtual work).

The aim of the project was to model the Drag Reduction System (DRS) for the Formula 1 cars.
The main difficulty of the project was that every part of a Formula 1 car is hidden by industrial secret, so it is hard to find public information and data.
The first assignment we had to do after the first few weeks of work was a requirement analysis and we did it using the House of Quality approach.
The final delivery at the end of the course comes together with this repository and includes:
- the Maple files containing the studies of the three main mechanisms (push-up, pod-pull and pod-rocker)
- the set of slides we used for presenting the project.

We studied both the kinematic and the dynamic for all the three configurations, but the configuration we studied the most is the pod-pull one, for which we also applied an optimization research, a control simulation and an hydraulic simulation (for the piston actuation).
